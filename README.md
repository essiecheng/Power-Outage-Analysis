## Introduction
This dataset created by the Laboratory for Advancing Sustainable Critical Infrastructure at Purdue University contains information about power outage data in the U.S. that occurred from January 2000 to July 2016.  The information in the dataset include general information about when and where power outages occur, regional climate information, outage events information, regional electricity consumption information, regional economic characteristics, and regional land-use characteristics. With this information available, a question of interest is where major power outages are more likely to occur and be severe.
